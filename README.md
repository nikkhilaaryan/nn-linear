# nn-linear

## Description
This project implements a **simple neural network from scratch using `NumPy`** to model a linear function:

\[ y = 2x + 3 \]

The network uses **gradient descent** to learn the slope (`m`) and intercept (`c`) from generated data. It is designed as a beginner-friendly example for understanding how neural networks work.
